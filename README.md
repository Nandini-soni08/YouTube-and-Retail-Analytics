# 📊 Internship Data Analytics Projects – YouTube & Retail Analysis

This repository contains two beginner-level data analytics projects completed using Python and Jupyter Notebook as part of an internship assignment. The goal was to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using real-world datasets without using any machine learning techniques.

These projects helped me improve my skills in data cleaning, data visualization, and generating insights using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
